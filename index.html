      <p> Here was the trailer of the movie, now lets talk about the main characters of the movie and the "Sinister 6"<p>
<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      
      <p> The <b>SINISTER SIX<b><p>
        
        <p>It was a supervillain team that Doctor Octopus founded, that is typically composed of six of Spider-Man and S.H.I.E.L.D.'s formidable foes to destroy Spider-Man, his teams and S.H.I.E.L.D. once and for all. <p>

   <p> Peter wants to go back to the time when no one knew he was Spider-Man. It’s a tricky request, but Doctor Strange agrees. In this thrilling new trailer, we get to see a lot of action, the return of the old villains from the 2000’s hits, including the hint of Green Goblin and Dr Octopus right at the end. <p>

        <p> I actually feel bad for poor spidey :( <p>
